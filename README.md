# WELCOME TO CAT MATCH
<br>
In june of this year (the year of our lord Beyonce, 2023), I decided to start a coding bootcamp in Miami. <br>
I was very nervous at first because it was an intensive program in concepts I had zero fluency in and I wasn't sure I was going to succeed. So, I walk in on the first day and head over to the common space and there's this guy sitting there all alone. I sit by him and ask him his name and it was bananas from there. We sat next to each other everyday for the remainder of the cohort and were partnered together for the first official hackathon. We snuck in our friend Victor to join our team and the three of us, together with our obsession with cats and our silly little attitudes, built Cat Match! <br>
<br>
<h2>Brainstation Hackathon 2023</h2>
The first of three hackathons boasted a simple prompt: You have <strong>six hours</strong> to build a website and your only requirement is that you must use an API.
<br>
So, naturally, we made a match game!

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
At the time, we had only been exposed to HTML, SCSS and Javascript, so the functionality of the website is vanilla js and the styling is all done with sass.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>SCSS</li>
  <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Axios</li>
</ul>
<br>
There are no plans to deploy it anytime soon, but maybe one day in the future!

<h3>My Role</h3>
One of the first things we did as soon as we sat down was decide who was strong in what. I immediately piped up that I was severely uncomfortable at the time with styling and overwhelmingly preferred to work on the functionality. My partners were incredibly adaptable and gave me free reign on the Javascript for the project. 
<br>
It really gave me an opportunity to play with the logic and challenged me to use everything I had learned in the first month of the program!
<br>
<br>

<strong>I hope you enjoy!</strong>
